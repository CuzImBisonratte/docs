# v2.0.1

## Grade exporting

Now you can export your notes. With the statistics update, it will also be possible to export statistics.
The most common use case is exporting and then deleting the grades to start a new planning period.

## Rounding

You can now decide for yourself whether your grades should be rounded to none, one or two decimal places.

To adjust the setting, you can simply go to the settings and adjust them to your preferences.

## Class- and Grade-View merged

We have merged the class and grade views because there was a lot of confusion because people were automatically switching between the two views without recognisable differences.

The whole thing meant that many people no longer understood where to find which information.

Now the class view and the grade view are combined under the class view icon and all functions have been merged.

## Other changes

- Registration is opened again
- Grade average calculation has been added again
- Note length has been increased to 25 characters
- Credits for the used OpenSource Software/Libraries have been used
- Every page now uses custom titles, so when used in browser they are easier to navigate
