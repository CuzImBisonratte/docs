# v2.1.0

## Homework

Noten-App now supports homework entries. When being in school you can enter your homework easily and check it when you are finished.

## Sorting

You can now choose in which way you want your classes sorted.

You can choose wheter it sorts by average, alphabetically or when you added the last grade. Just go into the settings and change it.

We did this so it is easier for you to organize your grades, look over them and get better in school.
